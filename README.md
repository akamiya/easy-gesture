Easystroke is a gesture-recognition application for X11. Gestures or strokes are movements that you make with you mouse (or your pen, finger etc.) while holding down a specific mouse button. Easystroke will execute certain actions if it recognizes the stroke; currently easystroke can emulate key presses, execute shell commands, hold down modifiers and emulate a scroll wheel. The program was designed with Tablet PCs in mind and can be used effectively even without access to a keyboard. Easystroke tries to provide an intuitive and efficient user interface, while at the same time being highly configurable and offering many advanced features.

# How can I help out?

If you encounter any bugs or problems with easystroke, please report them, preferably using [trac](https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/easystroke/report) (be sure to assign the ticket to me (thjaeger), so that I get notified by e-mail). Feature suggestions are also welcome, but note that I only have limited time to implement new features (usually, changes in the X server are enough to keep me busy).

The easystroke website is a wiki that anyone can edit (with the exception of the front page). Please feel free to add any information (tutorials, documentation, etc.) that might be interesting to other users. Work on the [Documentation](Documentation) page is especially appreciated, I don't have the time and patience to keep it up to date.
